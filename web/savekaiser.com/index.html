  	    <p class="intro">
  		K.C. Magic Data (aka Mr. Kevin Currie) has a trade-mark on the name "Kaiser" and is
  		actively trying to <b>SHUT DOWN</b> anyone that is using it. He is attempting to bring
  		legal action against me because I created <i>"Kaiser: The Card Game"</i> for iOS and
  		Android. <strike>He is claiming that he <b>OWNS
  		EVERYTHING ABOUT KAISER</b> including the name, the rules, and who can play it.</strike> (UPDATE: He seems to be changing his story and now claims that he owns ONLY the name now... success!) <b>WE BELIEVE THIS TO BE COMPLETELY FALSE!!</b><br><br>
  		This is your game Saskatchewan! It was played all around province long before Mr. Currie showed up. And now 
  		he's trying to steal it from you. Trade-mark law has rules to prevent this but it takes
  		lawyers and money to defend it!

Niiiice,

I like surprises… except when they’re C&D letters.  A bit of googling figured out who you are and that you own the 
“Kaiser" trademark.  I guess that’s on me for not looking earlier.

Here’s two options for you to consider to resolve this quickly:

A) Give me a license to use the name and I’ll advertise for you in the app. I can add a shout out to your website 
in the app description and the first time the user plays the game.  1,600+ free downloads of the app so far 
(1,100 yesterday). Every one of those could hear about your website.
B) I change the name (after confirming with a lawyer). This won’t hurt me at all but I figure I’d give you option A 
to consider anyway.

It’s up to you. If you want me to change the name, the app review process at Apple will take a couple of days so 
it’ll probably be done by the end of next week.

Take care,
Tod Baudais

IOS App Trade Mark and Copy rights infringement

It has come to my attention through publication and media that there is an IOS application that is being offered 
on the Apple Istore for download under the name Kaiser. It is listed as:
 
Kaiser: The Card Game by Smells Like Donkey, Inc.
https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/kaiser-the-card-game/id862618661?mt=8
 
I am officially informing Apple that I have reserved all rights in the name of Kaiser as it applies to the card 
game with its rules and regulations,
  
I also hold the United States Trade Mark and Copy Rights in parallel to the Canadian rights.  I have purchased these 
rights and I have preserved my rights to the Trade Mark of Kaiser the playing card game for now and forever.
  
Kaiser is a card game that is packaged and comes with a deck of 32 cards with rules and regulations, just like the 
original Uno was. The name and the rules and regulations of the game are owned by me Kevin Currie and are protected 
under my Trade Mark that was completed in 1984 for a Patent, Trade Mark and Copyrights for Canada and United States.
 
The Application that is infringing on these rights :
 
Kaiser: The Card Game by Smells Like Donkey, Inc.
https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/kaiser-the-card-game/id862618661?mt=8
 
The owner Has knowingly went ahead with this with the intent to change the name if I don’t follow his options. I have 
also included an attached email that was emailed to me today from Tod Baudais, the IOS maker for Smells Like Donkey 
that claims he is aware of the Trade Mark infringement and has intent to change the product name to deceive. My lawyers 
have informed me that this is still infringement because the card game rules and regulations are protected as listed 
with the wares. You will notice that the game is very popular in Saskatchewan where I am from and so is the publisher 
of the application. In fact we are from the same city where my Kaiser software are extremely popular here which is 
why I own the Rights to it.
 
Here is the recent Newspaper article that shows the game was designed to replicate my Kaiser the Card Game.
 
http://www.thestarphoenix.com/business/Kaiser+game+Sask+roots/9953382/story.html
 
 
I am simply requesting that the application be removed ASAP by law under the Trade Mark and infringement laws and not 
be allowed back on under any name using these rules and regulations as described in my Trade Mark. The app has already 
caused me legal fees and damages to my business reputation that I have worked hard and paid for to achieve that I will 
not recover from this.
 
As mentioned on the CIPO website my Representitive for Legal Service is:
 
TERRY J. ZAKRESKI
 
I thank you for your immediate attention on this matter

    <p>I'm not sure if I completely follow his train of thought - it's a bit scattered and illogical. I believe he's claiming
    he has a trade-mark (yes he does), a patent (not that I can find) and a copyright. I think the copyright claim
    is on the instructions that I copied from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_(card_game)">Wikipedia</a> and is protected
    under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License">
    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License</a>. He seriously thinks he owns everything about the game. Amazing!</p>
    
    <p>Regardless, it's time to lawyer up. I sent an email to an awesome guy that I have used in the 
    past - Brad Limpert: <a href="http://www.limpertlaw.com">Limpert Law</a></p>

Hi Brad,

I seemed to have stepped into a bit of a mess here that I hope you can help out with.  

I recently released an app for iOS called "Kaiser: The Card Game".  Kaiser is a Saskatchewan based game that has
been around quite a long time (according to this web site it was played before 1900 
http://www.pagat.com/pointtrk/kaiser.html).  Shortly after I released it, I got a mysterious email from someone
asking for my mailing address. Naturally, the alarm bells went off and I suspected some legal action was going
to be taken.  It turns out that some guy here trademarked it in the 80's.  I made the mistake of responding to
him and saying "oops, can we work this out?" but it was met with silence. And he used that email below.

Here's some links:
Trademark: http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do?lang=eng&status=&fileNumber=0502052&extension=0&startingDocumentIndexOnPage=21
His Game: http://www.kaisergame.com/Home/Kaiser/Home.html
My Game: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kaiser-the-card-game/id862618661?ls=1&mt=8

Well today I got the actual notice that he sent through Apple. See below.

So my questions are:
1. Can he actually own an enforceable trademark on this game? To me it's like someone Trademarking "Poker" or
"Chess". It existed for at least 80 years (and probably more) before he came around
2. What are my courses of action?

It's not like my app has been a big seller (approx $400 worth), but the fact that it seems like he took the game
from the people of Saskatchewan and made it his own kinda pisses me off. I'd love to tell him to bugger off.

Anyway take care,
Tod Baudais

P.S. If you think I should talk to a local lawyer about this, let me know.

    <p>And the response...</p>

    <p>We had a brief phone conversation a day or two later where Brad basically said "he can't trade-mark Kaiser". So... game on!</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h3>Trade-mark Law in Canada</h3>
    
    <p>Here's what I gathered so far about Trade-mark law in Canada. Note: I'm not a lawyer so if you're looking
    for legal advice, retain a lawyer!</p>
    
    <p>The trade-mark act can be found <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/FullText.html">Here</a></p>
    
    <p>The relevant sections for me were 16, 17, and 18 (with a bit of 22 sprinkled on top). See below...</p>
   
<p class="trademark"> 
<b>PERSONS ENTITLED TO REGISTRATION OF TRADE-MARKS</b><br><br>

16. (1) Any applicant who has filed an application in accordance with section 30 for registration of a trade-mark that is 
registrable and that he or his predecessor in title has used in Canada or made known in Canada in association with wares 
or services is entitled, subject to section 38, to secure its registration in respect of those wares or services, unless 
at the date on which he or his predecessor in title first so used it or made it known it was confusing with<br><br>
&emsp;(a) a trade-mark that had been previously used in Canada or made known in Canada by any other person;<br><br>
&emsp;(b) a trade-mark in respect of which an application for registration had been previously filed in Canada by any other person; or<br><br>
<font color="red">&emsp;(c) a trade-name that had been previously used in Canada by any other person.</font><br><br>
</p>

<p>This basically means that in order to register a trade-mark, it can't be used previously. Funny thing about the Trade-mark office
is that they don't actually have to check if this is the case or not. They just add sections to the law that invalidate it if any of these 
criteria were not met (SPOLIER!). See below.  Funny thing, Mr. Currie's website (kaisergame.com) states quite clearly that Kaiser was widely
played throughout Saskatchewan for a long time before he came along.</p>

<p class="trademark"> 
<b>VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF REGISTRATION</b><br><br>

17. (1) No application for registration of a trade-mark that has been advertised in accordance with section 37 shall be refused 
and no registration of a trade-mark shall be expunged or amended or held invalid on the ground of any previous use or making known 
of a confusing trade-mark or trade-name by a person other than the applicant for that registration or his predecessor in title, except 
at the instance of that other person or his successor in title, and the burden lies on that other person or his successor to establish 
that he had not abandoned the confusing trade-mark or trade-name at the date of advertisement of the applicant’s application.<br><br>

(2) In proceedings commenced after the expiration of five years from the date of registration of a trade-mark or from July 1, 1954, 
whichever is the later, no registration shall be expunged or amended or held invalid on the ground of the previous use or making known 
referred to in subsection <font color="red">(1), unless it is established that the person who adopted the registered trade-mark in Canada did so with 
knowledge of that previous use or making known.</font>
R.S., c. T-10, s. 17.
</p>

<p>This should be easy to prove. There's no way you can be in Saskatchewan and never have heard of Kaiser before. </p>

<p class="trademark"> 
<b>When registration invalid</b><br><br>

18. (1) The registration of a trade-mark is invalid if<br><br>
<font color="red">(a) the trade-mark was not registrable at the date of registration,</font><br><br>
<font color="red">(b) the trade-mark is not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are
commenced, or</font><br><br>
(c) the trade-mark has been abandoned, and subject to section 17, it is invalid if the applicant for registration was not the person entitled to secure the registration.
<br><br>

(2) No registration of a trade-mark that had been so used in Canada by the registrant or his predecessor in title as to have become
distinctive at the date of registration shall be held invalid merely on the ground that evidence of the distinctiveness was not submitted
to the competent authority or tribunal before the grant of the registration.
R.S., c. T-10, s. 18.
</p>

<p>It's pretty clear cut - his trade-mark is invalid. Section 16 stated why it was not registrable, and it's obvious that his
trade-mark is not distinctive.</p>

<p class="trademark"> 
22. (1) No person shall use a trade-mark registered by another person in a manner that is likely to have the effect of depreciating 
the value of the goodwill attaching thereto.<br><br>

<font color="red">(2) In any action in respect of a use of a trade-mark contrary to subsection (1), the court may decline to order the recovery
of damages or profits and may permit the defendant to continue to sell wares marked with the trade-mark that were in his possession or under
his control at the time notice was given to him that the owner of the registered trade-mark complained of the use of the trade-mark.</font>
</p>
 
<p>I thought that last bit was interesting.</p>




    <h3>July 8, 2014: The Demand Letter</h3>

<p>By this time, I'm not very worried about any kind of legal proceedings. I can't stop them from happening, but if they do I'm pretty much
guaranteed to win (It would still be expensive though!). I thought maybe Mr. Currie had come to his senses too because I hadn't heard anything
from him in a while.</p>
<p>Then I get the <a href="KaiserDemand.pdf">DEMAND LETTER</a> (pdf warning)</p>
<p>There's a few things that you can get out of this letter.</p>
<ol>
<li>He makes a grammatical mistake in the first sentence (the app "is in infringing"). Gave me a laugh.</li>
<li>He's pretty good at reading the law selectively. He really ought to read it to the end, that's the good part!</li>
<li>He made me realize that his rules pages are completely different than mine - i.e. no copyright infringement as he claims above. Again, 
mine were copied from Wikipedia so no worries anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>All I did with this letter is scanned it in and sent it to my lawyer. Then I went to bed and had a great sleep!</p>



    <h3>July 17, 2014: Curious Wikipedia Edits</h3>

<p>I guess I can't blame a guy for being protective, but this is kind of funny. Looks like he added a reference to his trade-mark in the
Wikipedia article... the same article I used for my instructions and will use in any court proceedings. Here's the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaiser_(card_game)&action=history">edit history</a>. This actually helps me a bit
because now I know his username and can see that he is not an original contributor to the article. Goodbye copyright claim!</p>
    


    <h3>July 18, 2014: Another email from Apple</h3>
    <p>Got another email from Apple. I have included the entire conversation with them in the email.  A few things to
    note:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Kevin is concerned about Apple sending his emails to me</li>
    <li>I might be hearing about a lawsuit sometime soon</li>
    </ol>

ref# APP38085

Could you please inform me if a deadline was given for them to provide the information you requested and when that 
deadline is?
If this person cannot provide written permission will the App be removed?
If this app is removed will they get to keep the money for each copy that was paid for or will it be refunded?
Will Apple allow the App back on with only a name change? If this is the case then I will be following up with the 
following action:
	According to section 19 of the Trademark Act the owner of a valid registered trade mark has the exclusive right to 
	the mark's use throughout Canada in respect of the wares or services for which it is registered. Section 20 
	provides that no unapproved person may sell, distribute, or advertise wares or services in association with a confusing 
	trademark or trade name and section 22 further prohibits a non-owner from using a registered mark in any manner likely 
	to deteriorate the value of the goodwill attached to the mark.
The common law protects marks by recognizing the owner's right to exclusive uses, subject to the geographical and market 
boundaries of the owner's established trade reputation..
Section 7(b) and 7(c) of the Trade-marks Act also codifies the tort of passing off into federal law.
I need to have all this information ahead of time to prepare for the Law Suit that will be filed within the next week.
Please exclude the other party from this email information.
Thank you
Kevin C

them as well or just between Apple and me?

    <p>And finally, my response to Apple</p>
    
    <pre>
Hi *****,

I’ll be sending out an official letter as soon as I get it from my lawyer. In short, trade-mark law is very specific 
about the validity of this trade-mark. The term “Kaiser”, as it relates to this specific card game, has been around 
for a very long time (possibly WWI and perhaps back to before 1900) - far longer than the trade-mark. This in itself 
makes the trade-mark "not registrable at the date of registration" and therefore invalid. It is also probably a bit 
too generic as well to pass any kind of scrutiny. I’m actually surprised Mr. Currie’s lawyer has not informed him of 
this - if he has even spoken with a lawyer.

As such, we will not be contacting Mr. Currie to resolve this matter. He needs to spend 5 minutes and read the law 
(i.e. sections 16,17 and 18 in the Canadian Trade-marks Act) for himself or at least ask his lawyer if he has any 
chance of winning any kind of legal action (we strongly feel that he does not). 

In the end, we would welcome any kind of legal proceedings because it’s the only way to get this trade-mark officially 
invalidated.

Again, official letter coming soon and, judging by the emails below, I’m sorry that this guy is such a pain-in-the-ass 
for you.

Take care,
Tod Baudais

    <h3>July 21, 2014: My Official Response to Apple</h3>

    <p>Well Brad at Limpert Law came through and typed up the <a href="AppleResponseJuly212014.pdf">official response to Apple</a> (pdf warning)</p>
    <p>I sent it out and cc'd Mr. Currie and his lawyer just so there's no mistaking our position.</p>

    <h3>July 24, 2014: Mr. Currie hires a lawyer</h3>
    
    <p>Mr. Currie hired a lawyer to write a few letters: <a href="Ltr_to_TBaudais-2014-07-24.pdf">One to me</a> and <a href="Ltr_to_Apple_with_encl-2014-07-24.pdf">One to Apple</a></p>
    <p>There's nothing new in them but it sure seems like they are trying to get the app taken down without going to court - presumably because they know they'll lose if a judge sees it.</p>

    <h3>August 5, 2014: Brad Strikes Back</h3>
    
    <p>Here's our <a href="Baudais-Letter-August_5_2014-2.pdf">response</a>. It's pretty straight forward.</p>

    <h3>August 13, 2014: Just when I thought everything was quiet...</h3>
    
    <p>I awoke this morning to a second email from some user complaining that the Android App store was telling him that Kaiser isn't available in his country (Canada). So I sent Google
    an email and here's their reply:</p>

    <pre>
Hello Tod,

Thanks for contacting Google Play Developer support.

Please be kindly reminded that your app is currently not available for distribution in Canada (Case 1-5331000004542).

You may contact the original complainant at the email address provided in your Google Play Trademark Notice. If the 
complainant responds to the original trademark notice to authorize the republishing of your app, and your app does 
not otherwise violate the Developer Distribution Agreement and Content Policy, we will reinstate the app.
If your account is still in good standing and the nature of your app allows for republishing you may consider 
releasing a new, non-infringing version of your app to Google Play under a new package name. We are unable to 
comment further on the specific basis for this removal or provide guidance on bringing future versions of your app 
into policy compliance. Instead, please reference the REASON FOR REMOVAL in the initial notification email from 
Google Play.

Please note that additional violations may result in a suspension of your Google Play Developer account.

If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.
Best regards,
*****
The Google Play Team

trademark_explain: "KAISER" when applied to any "playing card game" in 
Canada belongs to me. My TM was registered in 1985 as a playing card game. 
I have been selling my Kaiser card game on computers since 1996.

This Google app is counterfeit, piracy and trademark infringement because 
it has stolen my Kaiser card game from www.kaisergame.com and selling it 
as "Kaiser: The Card Game", without my consent. It is using the exact same 
game with the exact same title in Canada that i have owned for 30 years and 
currently sell on my website for Windows computers. The Counterfeiter is 
well aware of this infringement because they are also selling it on Apple 
and we are working with Apple regarding this piracy.
Just look at my trademark and look at my website there is no question that 
i own it. You will even notice we are from the same city of Saskatoon and 
province of Saskatchewan in Canada.

<p>Well a few things are abundantly apparent:</p>
<ol>
<li>He says "KAISER when applied to any playing card game in Canada belongs to me."</li>
<li>He refers to Kaiser as "my Kaiser card game"</li>
<li>He thinks he has "owned the game for 30 years"</li>
<p>Forget about the thousands (or tens of thousands!) of people that have played it their whole life
and have had it passed down to them through several generations of people... IT'S HIS GAME!!</p>

</ol>

    <h3>August 14, 2014: Another Trade-mark in the works</h3>

    <p>A Reddit user, <b>/u/deusextelevision</b>, tipped me off that Mr. Currie has applied for
    another trade-mark listed <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do?lang=eng&status=OK&fileNumber=0502052&extension=1&startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>It's kind of funny because "Kaiser: The Card Game" already fits that description. It is a "Computer game"
    that "provides multiple user access to a computer network" via a high score list.</p>
    
    <p>I sent it off to Mr. Limpert and we'll see what he has to say about it.</p>


    <h3>August 14, 2014: Metro News</h3>
    
    <p>Morgan Jacob of Metro News in Regina picked up the story and they wrote an awesome article. Mr. Currie was also interviewed.</p>
    <p><a href="http://metronews.ca/news/regina/1126994/war-of-the-kaisers-popular-prairie-card-game-in-trademark-dispute/">metronews.ca</a></p>
    <p>Here's my thoughts:</p>
    <ol>
  		<li><b>"If anyone wanted to design a game that was identical to mine and sell it with another name on it then that is 
  		fair competition in the trade market"</b><br>Whoa. That's a radical change of story! Previously he has been saying that Kaiser 
  		is his game and he owns everything about it. My guess is that his lawyer explained to him what a trade-mark is and what it does.</li>
  		<li><b>"My plan after buying the trademark was to release the iOS and Google and Mac versions and tie them into my online game"</b><br>
  		<b>"My only goal now is to try and stop the person who has taken that dream from me."</b><br>
  		Because Apple and Google are only going to allow one Kaiser app on the App Store.</li>
  		<li>I am a "dream ruiner"</li>
  	</ol>

    <h3>August 15, 2014: CBC Radio and Web</h3>
    
    <p>CBC radio in Saskatoon picked up on the story too. Apparently one of the readers of this site tipped them off. Thanks anonymous person!</p>
    <p>
    <a href="images/20140815_074850.png"><img src="images/20140815_074850.icon.png" width="150" height="113"></a>

    <p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/Local+Shows/Saskatchewan/ID/2489162004/">Radio interview here</a></p>
    
    <p>There's also a writeup on the web version of the story here:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/kaiser-card-game-app-leads-to-legal-battle-1.2737655">Web article here</a></p>

    <h3>August 15, 2014: Legal action against me has started!</h3>
    
    <p><b>I hear from Mr. Currie's lawyer that I'm officially getting sued... or in his words "legal action which was commenced yesterday". 
    I guess one way or another we're going to figure out who is correct.</b></p>

    <h3>August 17, 2014: CTV News</h3>
    
    <p>I just turned down an interview at CTV news for today. I want to get all of the paperwork for the lawsuit and make sure I have all 
    the facts before making too many guesses as to what's going on. Plus now that Mr. Curries' is no longer saying that he owns everything
    about the game except the name, the story is probably less interesting than before.</p>
    <p>I guess the only thing left to do is figure out if he owns the name or not...</p>
