DT3
===

This is the basic engine code for the DT3 Game Engine. I would recommend that you start off with one of the sample projects and work from there.

A few things to note:
- I have included compiled FFMPEG libs for iOS and Android. The iOS ones exceeded github's max file size limit so they are zipped
- Some modules aren't done (Looking at you out of date windows port)
- Qt will need to be installed

1. Download Qt 5.1.1 from qt-project.org. http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/qtproject/official_releases/qt/5.1/5.1.1/qt-mac-opensource-5.1.1-clang-offline.dmg
2. Run the installer and change the install location to /Developer/Qt5.1.1 when prompted
